# COVID19-OREGON


 Here is some data analysis I'm doing on COVID19 worldwide and also in my home states of New York and Oregon. I'm heavily relying on data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 (John Hopkins) for aggregate US and worldwide data and also from NYC.gov https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf which has the most detailed statewide data that I've found. New York in many ways is a petri dish for what might happen in other states.


I love data visualization and trending data. All you need to do is pull down the https://github.com/jakemathai/COVID19-OREGON/blob/master/COVID-NewDataFormat.ipynb jupyter notebook and it should just run.

If you have detailed data for Oregon like NYC (see link) https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf, I would be very interested with working with you and this data. 

Good luck everybody & be safe.
