# COVID-19 Oregon and NYC Data Analysis 


 Here is some data analysis I'm doing on COVID19 worldwide and also in my home states of New York and Oregon. I'm heavily relying on data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 (John Hopkins) for aggregate US and worldwide data and also from NYC.gov https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf which has the most detailed statewide data that I've found. New York in many ways is a petri-dish for what might happen in other states including Oregon.

<b>DATA SOURCES:</b><br>

* John Hopkins (JH CSSE): https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19<br>
*  NYC.gov: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf  <br>

<b>HOW TO USE: </b><br>
 All you need to do is pull down the https://github.com/jakemathai/COVID19-OREGON/blob/master/COVID-NewDataFormat.ipynb jupyter notebook and it should just run.
 
 <b>HELP US:</b><br>
 
If you have detailed data for Oregon like NYC (see link) https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary.pdf, I would be very interested with working with you and this data. See contact details below.
